# spring-angular

## Angular

Before starting development run `npm install` in the `ng` subfolder once.

Alternatively, run the Gradle task `npmInstall`.

To start development mode, issue these commands:

1. Run `npm start`
1. Open <http://localhost:4200> in a browser

To execute Angular component tests:

1. Run `npm test`
1. Open <http://localhost:9876> to view results of Karma test runner

To run end-to-end tests:

1. Edit `protractor.conf.js` and change `browserName` to whatever browser to use for testing
1. Run `npm run e2e`

*Note: It is possible to specify multiple browsers. Some supported ones are:* `chrome`, `firefox`

Run `npm run build` to build static assets for productive use.

Update Angular and related dependencies to the next version using the command `ng update --all`.

## Spring Boot

Run the Gradle task `bootJar` to build an executable standalone jar without static assets.

To bring it all together, run the task `docker` to create a Docker image containing the Spring Boot application including the Angular app.

Alternatively, place the static assets generated by the Angular build in `ng/dist` under `src/main/resources/static` and then run the `bootJar` task.
