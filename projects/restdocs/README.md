# restdocs

Run the Gradle task `bootJar` to build a JAR file of the Spring Boot application as well as the documentation.

The HTML documentation generated during tests will be placed in `build/docs`.

Start the application and open <http://localhost:8080/docs/spring-restdocs.html> in a browser to view the HTML documentation.
